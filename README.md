# SCM
Source Code Management


Project Part-1: Create Repository

Introduction:
This project part is the first step to build our SCM (Source Code Management) project (AKA a VCS: Version Control System). This part only implements an initial usecase: Create Repository. It is only a "Success Path" and contains "no frills". The SCM repository will contain multiple versions of the same file and each file version will be identified using the artifact id (version number of the file) and the path in which it is stored in the repository. Each change in the file will be recorded in the activity folder as a manifest file.

External Requirements: 
Eclipse (Java)
